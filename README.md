# MISRA Guideline Compliance Summary (GCS) plugin for Jenkins

This plugin creates a MISRA GCS - a table listing the MISRA guidelines and their status in your project. The status can be *compliant*, *violations*, *deviations* or *dissapplied*. A MISRA GCS must be available when claiming MISRA compliance.

The plugin works by

1. Scanning a file of warnings produced by a MISRA checking tool
2. Scanning the source code for warning-suppression comments and tags

An important key to usage of this plugin is the tags which can be added to suppression comments. Adding and reviewing these tags should be part of your development process.

### Supported tools

* [PC-lint](#PC-lint)
* [Cppcheck](#Cppcheck)

At the moment, these are the only supported MISRA checking tools. However, [adding support for new tools is easy](#newtools).

### Supported MISRA guidelines

The three MISRA C guideline versions 1998, 2004 and 2012 as well as the C++ guidelines from 2008 are supported. Some tools may not support all versions. 

### Suppression comments

Most static code analysis tools support some form of warning suppression using specially formatted comments in the code.  For example, for PC-lint these comments use the format

`/*lint -e333 Blah blah blah */`

with some variations. The "-e333" part is the warning code used internally in PC-lint. The GCS plugin converts each such code to a set of MISRA guidelines. If no tags are added to this comment, the plugin will mark all guidelines which are suppressed by the comment as <i>violations</i>.

### Adding tags to suppression comments

Tags consist of certain keywords written in all caps that are added anywhere within a suppression comment. The following tags are understood by the plugin:

* GUIDELINE
* NON-MISRA
* FALSE POSITIVE
* DEVIATION

##### Non-MISRA tags

The warning tool you are using may be emitting warnings for possible problems that are not in violation of any MISRA guidelines. In such cases you can add the NON-MISRA tag to your suppression comment. The comment will be ignored by the plugin.

The same tag can be used if there are comments that fit the suppression pattern that aren't actually suppressing anything - such as other instructions to the checking tool.

Examples:

`/*lint -e423 Tool complains about this and that, but it's fine and not a MISRA rule. NON-MISRAÂ */`

`//lint -save NON-MISRA (not suppressing anything)`

##### False positive tags

Sometimes a tool will emit a warning for some piece of code that the developer can determine is not actually in violation of the guideline in question. This is called a false positive. When the tag FALSE POSITIVE (or FALSE-POSITIVE or FALSEPOSITIVE) is added to the suppression comment, the suppression is ignored by the plugin. However, unlike the NON-MISRA tag, the plugin will only accept a FALSE POSITIVE tag when it can actually find out which guideline(s) is suppressed by the comment.

A suppression comment may suppress warnings for some guidelines  that are actually violated and some that are not. In this case, you can add an argument to the FALSE POSITIVE tag in the form FALSEPOSITIVE(Rule 3.1). This tells the tool that rule 3.1 is not violated, but other guidelines suppressed by this comment are still violated. You can add multiple such rule-specific tags to a single comment. 

Examples:

`/* cppcheck-suppress misra-c2012-5.1; FALSE POSITIVE not actually in breach of the guideline */`

`/*lint -esym(n, 944) PC-lint gives warnings for directive 1.1, rule 2.3 and rule 5.4, but actually only 5.4 is violated. FALSE POSITIVE(Directive 1.1) FALSE POSITIVE(Rule 2.3) */`

##### Guideline tags

The plugin may not always be able to determine which guideline warnings are being suppressed for a specific comment. In such cases, you <i>must</i> add one or more GUIDELINE(&lt;guideline name&gt;) tags to the comment. This tag tells the plugin which guideline is being suppressed. It can be combined with other tags.

Example:

`/*lint -e455 Violation of rule 2.4. GUIDELINE(Rule 2.4) */`

##### Deviation tags

Deviations are violations that have been documented and formally approved. You can add a DEVIATION(...) tag to a suppression comment to show that this violation has been formally permitted. The tag takes one, two or three arguments: First is the deviation reference, such as the a document number or deviation number. Second (optional) is a web link to the deviation record - the link will be shown in the GCS report. Third is the guideline which is being deviated, if necessary.

**Note**: *The protocol marker "http://" contains a double slash - but using double slashes within a comment is illegal according to some MISRA guidelines. You should omit the double slash and replace it by a single slash or nothing. The ":" by itself is sufficient to show that the part to the left is the protocol.*

Examples:

`/*lint -e543 We break the rules, but mgmnt says it's ok. DEVIATION(D22) */`

`/* cppcheck-suppress misra-c2012-7.11 This time we have a link too. DEVIATION(D23,  https:tinyurl.com/2fcpre6) */`

`/*lint -e32 This comment suppresses more than one violation, but there is a deviation only for one of them, so we need to mark it with the rule number. DEVIATION(D24,  https:tinyurl.com/2fcpre6, Rule 5.1) FALSEPOSITIVE(Rule 1.1) */`

`/*lint -e45 This time we specify the guideline, but we don't have a link, so just leave the second argument empty. DEVIATION(D33,, Rule 5.1) */`

### Guideline Re-categorization Plan (GRP)

Guidelines come in the three categories "Advisory", "Required" and "Mandatory", but may be re-categorized on a project-basis by a guideline re-categorization plan (GRP). The legal re-categorizations are

- Required -> Mandatory
- Advisory -> Mandatory
- Advisory -> Required
- Advisory -> Disapplied

If a GRP exists, a pure text version of the GRP must be given as input to the plugin. Each line of the text file should contain the guideline name followed by the new category.

Example pure-text GRP file:

```
Rule 1.1, Mandatory
Rule 4.1, Required
Rule 5.1, Disapplied
```

### List of source files

One of the inputs to the plugin is a list of all source files to be scanned. The list is itself a text file where each line contains the path to a file, relative to the workspace root. The list should contain header files as well as source files. A natural approach is to generate this file using for example a shell script step before the GCS plugin runs.

### Result

The end result is either compliant or not compliant - the project is compliant as long as there are no violations of required or mandatory rules (or rules that have been re-categorized as required or mandatory). The report will be created even if the code is deemed not compliant. You can elect to have Jenkins mark the build as failed if the code is not compliant.

### Tool settings

For each checking tool, the plugin requires a specific output syntax in order to properly parse the output. The settings required in order to produce the correct output are given in this section

##### PC-lint

PC-lint should be set to produce output of the same format used for the warnings plugin. Details can be found [here](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/PcLint+options). These are the essential settings:

```
+ffn // force full path names
-width(0) // don't insert line breaks (unlimited output width).
-hf1 // message height one
-"format=%f(%l): %t %n: %m"
```
##### Cppcheck
Cppcheck comes with [a python add-on specifically to check MISRA guidelines](https://github.com/danmar/cppcheck/blob/master/addons/misra.py). At the time of writing, only the C 2012 version of the guidelines is supported. Since suppressions in a separate file are not yet supported, you will need to use [inline suppressions](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/manual.html#idm479), so run cppcheck with the option `--inline-suppr` . Suppressions for the python add-on are  in the format 

```
/* cppcheck-suppress misra-c2012-4.1 ; your tags here e.g. DEVIATION(D3) */
```

Here 4.1 is the rule number to suppress. Note the semicolon between the rule identifier and your tags. You do not need a ["MISRA Text file"](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/manual.html#idm429) to use with cppcheck for this plugin to work, although it helps to clarify the warnings from the cppcheck addon.


### Log of suppressions

The plugin can generate a text file containing a log of suppressed violations with file names and line numbers of where they occur. The log is in the format of warnings from the clang-compiler, so that it can be parsed automatically by existing tools. Each suppression has a warning level, either `info`, `warning` or `error`. The `info` level is given to violations of advisory guidelines,  non-MISRA tags, false positive tags and deviation tags. The info tag indicates that a code reviewer should verify the tag or violation. The `warning` level is given to suspicious non-MISRA tags. The `error` level is given to untagged violations of required and mandatory guidelines.

The log can be used to automatically generate useful info for code review using for example the *violation comments to bitbucket server* plugin using the CLANG format settings.

Example log:

```
file1.c:20: info: Violation of Rule 1.2 (Advisory)
file2.c:30: info: Deviation of Rule 2.1 (Advisory)
file3.c:5: info: Suppression of Directive 1.1 (Mandatory) tagged as false positive
file4.c:3: info: Tool suppression comment tagged as not MISRA relevant
file5.c:22: warning: Tool suppression comment tagged as not MISRA relevant, but PC-Lint indicates that this comment suppresses Rule 1.1 and Rule 1.2
file6.c:1: error: Violation of Directive 1.1 (Mandatory)
file7.c:2: error: Violation of Rule 2.2 (Required)
```





### Example GCS

### Adding support for new analysis tools
</a>
To add a support for another analysis tools, simply add a new class which extends the abstract class `WarningParser`, adding the annotation *@Extension*. Due to the annotation, the class will be automatically discovered - you don't need to do anything to integrate it into the plugin. For example:

```java
@Extension
public class MyFancyToolWarningParser extends WarningParser 
```

Some abstract methods from `WarningParser` need to be implemented, namely:

```java
/** Parse a line from the output of the MISRA checker tool (e.g. PC-lint).
 *  
 * @param line  A single line of text from the parser tools output. The parser should
 *              be configured so that a violation does not cover more than one line.
 * @return      A list of MISRA-violations described by this line. If the line does not
 *              represent any MISRA-violations, return null or an empty list.
 */
protected abstract List<Violation> parseWarningLine(String line);


/**
 * Parse the contents of a source code file, and return a list of all
 * suppression comments in the file. A suppression comment is a comment that is
 * used to suppress a warning from the checker tool. For example, for PC-lint
 * this is every comment that starts out with "lint" immediately following the
 * comment opening symbol. The returned string should contain the full text of
 * the comment, including any suppression tokens.
 * 
 * @param fileContent The full contents of the source file as a string
 * @return A list of all suppression comments in the file
 */
protected abstract List<String> findSuppressionComments(String fileContent);

/** For a single suppression comment, find each MISRA violation that is suppressed by 
 *  this comment.
 *  <p> 
 *  Note: This is likely the most difficult method to implement, since it may have
 *        to map tool error codes to MISRA guidelines. If this mapping is too complex,
 *        you can implement this method to always return null. This will force the user
 *        to always add a GUIDELINE(...) tag to suppression comments, or end up with 
 *        an invalid report.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @param comment  A suppression comment from the source file
 * @return         A set of guidelines suppressed by this comment, e.g "Rule 1.2". 
 *                 Return null or an empty set if no MISRA guidelines are suppressed,
 *                 or we could not determine which guideline is suppressed by this 
 *                 comment.
 */
protected abstract Set<String> getGuidelineIdsFromComment(String comment);

/**
 * @return The name of this warning parser
 */
public abstract String name();
```
